# Salty Dogs

Open source, open world pirate RPG. With furries.

Prototype is currently running off of app/cameratest.js

To play the prototype, run game.debug.html. Works out of the box in Firefox. Chrome requires the Turbulenz server to be running or it won't load textures.

Built with `makehtml --mode canvas-debug -t . makefile.html makefile.js -o game.debug.html`

Left click to move, right click to attack, or WASD and K.
